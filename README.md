# pyNN_example
A few Colab Notebooks that can be used to get started with pyNN and test virtual sPyNNaker without many issues. pyNN is a platform for describing spiking neural network models, and sPyNNaker is a physical neuromorphic computing system. Other tutorials for these systems that may be useful can be found [here](http://spinnakermanchester.github.io/workshops/eighth.html) and [here](http://spinnakermanchester.github.io/spynnaker/5.0.0/). The pyNN documentation is [here](http://neuralensemble.org/docs/PyNN/), and a version of the HBP Neuromorphic Computing Platform document can be found [here](https://electronicvisions.github.io/hbp-sp9-guidebook/).

This code is meant to be run on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true), but it could also be run on any Linux system with some modifications. While it is possible to install the pyNN backends on Windows, using Colab might make our lives a lot easier.
